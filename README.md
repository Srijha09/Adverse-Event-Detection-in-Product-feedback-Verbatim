# Multi-label-Text-Classification
Most of us get confused between Multi label Classification and Multi-class classification. There is a subtle difference here.
Multi-class classification means a classification task with more than two classes; each label are mutually exclusive. The classification makes the assumption that each sample is assigned to one and only one label whereas Multi-label classification assigns to each sample a set of target labels. This can be thought as predicting properties of a data-point that are not mutually exclusive.
It can be used in real life applications such as classifying movies into one or more genre
